# noinfopath-mailparser

Forked from the original nodemailer/mailparser project, which is now deprecated.  Maintaining here because a project we have has a dependency on it.

Advanced email parser for Node.js. Everything is handled as a stream which should make it able to parse even very large messages (100MB+) with relatively low overhead.

See [mailparser homepage](https://nodemailer.com/extras/mailparser/) for documentation and terms.
